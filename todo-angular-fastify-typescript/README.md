# Todo example with RethinkDB, Fastify and AngularJS

This was originally an example to illustrate AngularJS. It was slightly modified to support a real server that would save the todos.
*And that one was also modified to be generated from Typescript code and ExppressJS was replaced by Fastify.
The code using rethinkdb is in the file `app.ts`.

### Run ###

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Start the server with
```
npm run start
```
